![App Logo](https://i.postimg.cc/43YZZ70R/presplash.png)

**TG Photo Backup** is a lightweight, open-source alternative to Google Photos ‚Äî with a twist: it offers **unlimited photo storage** by leveraging **Telegram bots** to back up your images.

Unlike traditional cloud storage apps, this one sends your photos directly to a Telegram chat as both compressed images and original-quality files.

## üì± Getting Started

1. **Install the App** on your Android device.
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Permissions (Important!)
  
  > üõë **Note for User:**  
  > This app **does not request permissions automatically**. You must grant them manually after installation.
  
  ##### Manually grant these permissions for proper functionality:
  
  1. **All Files Access**
    
  2. **Photos and Videos Access**
    
  3. **Background Activity (optional but recommended)**
    
  4. **Internet Access** (usually granted by default)
    
  
  #### ‚úÖ How to grant manually:
  
  - Go to **Settings > Apps > TG Photo Backup > Permissions**
    
  - Enable **Files and media**, and set it to **"Allow access to all files"**
    
  - Also enable access to **Photos and Videos**
    
  
  Without these permissions, the app **cannot read your photos** or **sync them to Telegram**.
3. **Configure Your Settings:**
  - Go to the `Settings` tab.
  - Enter:
    - Your **Telegram Bot API Key**
    - Your **Chat ID**
    - **Included Storage Paths**, e.g.:
      
      ```
      /storage/emulated/0
      ```
      
    - **Excluded Storage Paths** (optional), e.g.:
      
      ```
      /storage/emulated/0/Android,/storage/emulated/0/telegram
      ```
      
4. **Save Settings & Restart App**
5. On first launch, allow some time for image thumbnail generation.
6. Choose to **Backup** manually or **Sync**:
  - Sync will upload only new or missing photos.

## üß™ Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è This is my first release. The app might:

- Be **laggy** during image previews
- Take time to **initialize thumbnails**
- Be **slow** due to being written in Python

üìå Recommended: Use the app **only for backup/sync**, **not** for image viewing.
